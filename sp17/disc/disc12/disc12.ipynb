    "So we've seen a few examples where k-means fails to recover the true clusters in a plot.  Under the hood, there seems to be preference for non-overlap (see [Voronoi diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram), similarly-sized groups, and equivariance (\"spheres\"). But perhaps we're being disingenuous here for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In these examples, we know the data generating process and hence the \"natural\" groups.  k-means is generally viewed as an unsupervised clustering algorithm\n",
    "1. We ask k-means to optimize the within-cluster sum of squares and are surprised when it \"doesn't act the way we expect.\" It is, in fact, our expectations that are a bit out of line since in these examples, our implicit \"optimal\" clustering differs from k-mean's objective.\n",
    "1. k-means is one of many tools. It's the analyst's job to pick the right one for the right job.\n",
    "\n",
    "These ideas are encapsulated in what are called [No Free Lunch](https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/m/profile/dhw/papers/78.pdf) theorems, which in a nutshell says that any optimization algorithm that is trying to solve a real question is powered by <s>hopes and dreams</s> assumptions on the real world.  Treat these objects as black boxes at your own peril. "
